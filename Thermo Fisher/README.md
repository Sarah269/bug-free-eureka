## Project
Analyzed Real-time PCR amplification curves and determined cycle thresholds for different genes.  Evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a hypothetical disease.  Researched Real-time PCR assays assessing their limits and positive percent agreements.

## Specificity Hypothetical 
<pre>
a) The number of true positives is  505 
b) The number of true negatives is 450 
c) The number of false negatives is 20 
d) The number of false positives is 25  
e) The sensitivity of the test is 96.19 
100 x 505 / (505 + 20) = 50,500/525 = 96.19 
f) The specificity of the test is 94.74 
100 x 450 / (25+450) = 45,000/475 = 94.74
